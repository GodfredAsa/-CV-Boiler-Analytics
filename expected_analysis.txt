Subject: Expected Analysis from data.xlsx

Dear Team,

Based on the data provided in data.xlsx, the following analyses can be conducted to inform our CV boiler monitoring project:

1. **CV Boiler Distribution:**
   - Total number of CV boilers: 30,855
   - Average number of CV boilers per postal code: 2.28
   - Median number of CV boilers per postal code: 2.00
   - Top 10 postal codes by number of CV boilers (e.g., 6451 GR with 45 boilers)

2. **Individual CV Boilers:**
   - Number of postal codes with individual CV boilers: 6,050
   - Total number of individual CV boilers: 6,050
   - These individual boilers would each require a separate Gateway if no sharing is possible.

3. **Cost Implications:**
   - Estimated total cost for individual Gateways: €4,840,000 (6,050 × €800)
   - Cost per individual CV boiler: €800 (including installation)
   - Potential cost savings if Gateways can be shared among multiple boilers in dense areas.

4. **RF Coverage and Gateway Placement:**
   - Simulate RF coverage using tools like RadioPlanner or LoRaSim.
   - Optimize Gateway placement based on the following criteria:
     - Urban areas: < 1 km line-of-sight
     - Suburban areas: < 3 km line-of-sight
     - LoRa packet loss < 1% per sensor per 24 hours
     - Min RSSI > –120 dBm
     - Min SNR > –10 dB

5. **Clustering Analysis:**
   - Identify postal codes with multiple CV boilers to assess the potential for Gateway sharing.
   - Calculate the average number of boilers per Gateway in dense areas.

6. **Visualization and Reporting:**
   - Create histograms and charts to visualize the distribution of CV boilers per postal code.
   - Prepare a detailed report summarizing the findings and recommendations for Gateway placement.

Please review this analysis and let me know if any additional insights or data points should be included.

Best regards,
