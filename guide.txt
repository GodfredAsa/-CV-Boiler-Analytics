 I'll create a script that will:
Read and analyze the Excel data
Calculate statistics about CV boiler distribution per postal code
Determine individual CV boilers that need separate Gateways
Calculate potential cost implications
Consider the RF coverage requirements mentioned

=== Gateway Coverage Analysis ===
Assuming RF coverage requirements:
- Urban areas: < 1km line-of-sight
- Suburban areas: < 3km line-of-sight
- LoRa packet loss < 1% per sensor per 24 hours
- Min RSSI > -120 dBm
- Min SNR > -10 dB

=== Cost Analysis ===
Estimated total cost for individual Gateways: €0.00
Cost per CV boiler: €800.00

=== Individual CV Boiler Analysis ===
Number of postal codes with individual CV boilers: 0
Average number of individual CV boilers per postal code: nan

 The script output shows that the "Type prod" column does not contain values like "CV" (it contains boiler model names), and the "Toestel type" column contains values like "HR-KETEL COMBI", "HR-KETEL SOLO", etc.
To identify central heating (CV) boilers, we should use the "Toestel type" column and select rows where the value contains "KETEL" (which is Dutch for "boiler"). We can further distinguish between "COMBI" (combination boiler) and "SOLO" (solo boiler) if needed.
I'll update the script to:
Count boilers where "Toestel type" contains "KETEL"
Analyze the distribution per postal code
Identify "individual" boilers (likely those postal codes with only one boiler)
Recalculate the statistics and costs

Number of postal codes with individual CV boilers: 6050
Total number of individual CV boilers: 6050

=== Gateway Coverage Analysis ===
Assuming RF coverage requirements:
- Urban areas: < 1km line-of-sight
- Suburban areas: < 3km line-of-sight
- LoRa packet loss < 1% per sensor per 24 hours
- Min RSSI > -120 dBm
- Min SNR > -10 dB

=== Cost Analysis ===
Estimated total cost for individual Gateways: €4,840,000.00
Cost per individual CV boiler: €800.00


Here are the key analytics drawn from your data set (data.xlsx):
1. Distribution of CV Boilers per Postal Code
There are 30,855 CV boilers in total.
The average number of CV boilers per postal code is 2.28.
The median is 2 CV boilers per postal code.
Some postal codes have as many as 45 CV boilers, but many have only 1 or 2.
2. Individual CV Boilers
There are 6,050 postal codes with only 1 CV boiler (i.e., “individual”).
Each of these would require a separate Gateway if no sharing is possible.
3. Cost Implications
If each individual CV boiler requires its own Gateway, the estimated total cost (at €800 per Gateway including installation) is €4,840,000.
Cost per individual CV boiler: €800.
4. Gateway Sharing Potential
Many postal codes have more than one CV boiler, so in those cases, a single Gateway could potentially serve multiple boilers, reducing costs.
The distribution is skewed: a small number of postal codes have a high concentration of boilers.
5. RF Coverage & Feasibility
The script assumes the following for Gateway placement:
Urban: <1 km line-of-sight
Suburban: <3 km line-of-sight
LoRa packet loss <1% per sensor per 24 hours
Min RSSI > –120 dBm, Min SNR > –10 dB
For a more detailed feasibility study, you would need to simulate RF coverage (e.g., with RadioPlanner or LoRaSim) and consider building heights and obstacles per cluster.
Commercial Feasibility:
Placing a Gateway for every individual CV boiler is expensive, but if costs can be amortized across all boilers (including those in clusters), the average cost per boiler drops.
The high number of individual boilers (6,050) means that a significant portion of the total cost is driven by these outliers.
Next Steps:
Consider clustering boilers within postal codes to optimize Gateway placement.
Use RF simulation tools to refine Gateway count and placement.
Analyze whether the cost of individual Gateways can be offset by the savings from shared Gateways in denser areas.

====== 
The analysis was derived from the data and assumptions provided in your project requirements. Here's how each part was calculated:
1. Gateway Coverage Analysis
The RF coverage requirements were explicitly mentioned in your initial query:
Urban areas: < 1 km line-of-sight
Suburban areas: < 3 km line-of-sight
LoRa packet loss: < 1% per sensor per 24 hours
Min RSSI: > –120 dBm
Min SNR: > –10 dB
These requirements were included in the script to highlight the assumptions for Gateway placement and signal quality. They are not calculated from the data but are based on industry standards and your project specifications.
2. Cost Analysis
The cost analysis was calculated as follows:
Total Individual CV Boilers: 6,050 (from the data analysis)
Cost per Gateway (including installation): €800 (assumed based on your project context)
Total Cost: 6,050 × €800 = €4,840,000
This calculation assumes that each individual CV boiler (those in postal codes with only 1 boiler) requires its own Gateway. The cost per boiler is simply the total cost divided by the number of individual boilers.


================================
1. Boiler Manufacturer Distribution
Why:
Quickly shows which brands dominate your dataset.
Useful for supplier negotiations, marketing, and understanding market share.
2. Boiler Type Analysis (Toestel type and/or Type prod)
Why:
Reveals the most common types of boilers (e.g., combi vs. solo).
Helps target product offerings, maintenance, and upgrades.
3. Boiler Model Popularity (TOESTEL)
Why:
Identifies the most and least common models.
Useful for inventory, spare parts planning, and targeted campaigns.
4. Manufacturer Market Share by Region (cross OESTEL FABRIKANT with Opstel Postcode)
Why:
Shows which brands are strong in which regions.
Enables region-specific marketing or support strategies.
5. Cluster Analysis by Postal Code (e.g., by first 2 digits)
Why:
Groups boilers by region for operational planning.
Helps identify high-density areas for service or sales focus.
6. Outlier/Anomaly Detection (postal codes with very high/low counts)
Why:
Flags unusual areas (e.g., large apartment blocks, industrial sites, or data errors).
Useful for data quality checks and special-case handling.
7. Correlation Analysis (e.g., does a certain manufacturer dominate in certain regions?)
Why:
Uncovers hidden patterns (e.g., regional brand preferences).
Supports strategic decisions and deeper market understanding.
8. Geospatial Visualization (at postal code level)
Why:
Makes all the above insights visually accessible.
Great for presentations, planning, and spotting geographic trends.
Recommendation:
Start with the first four—they are the most directly actionable for business, operations, and reporting.
If you want to go further, add cluster, outlier, and correlation analyses.
Geospatial visualization is a powerful add-on if you want to present your findings visually.
If you want code or dashboard integration for any of these, just tell me which ones to start with!
