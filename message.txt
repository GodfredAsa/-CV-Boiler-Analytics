Enoch,

Could you please give attention to the question that is still open regarding the attached Excel file?

Based on the data, what can we determine about the distribution of central heating (CV) boilers within a single postal code?
How many CV boilers are “individual” within a postal code and thus each require a separate Gateway?

The goal of this analysis is to be able to make a statement about how many CV boilers can share a single Gateway, and what the associated costs are for the purchase and installation of the Gateways.

Is it commercially feasible to place a Gateway for individual CV boilers as well, and amortize these costs within the entire proposition?

In CHAT, the following option was also proposed based on the Excel file.
Please review whether this is relevant and feasible to include in the above question:

Coverage analysis per postal code area using RF simulation (e.g., RadioPlanner, LoRaSim)

Max. distance sensor → gateway < 1 km in urban areas, < 3 km in suburban (line-of-sight)

LoRa packet loss uplink < 1% per sensor per 24 hours

Min. RSSI value for acceptance > – 120 dBm

Min. SNR for acceptance > – 10 dB

Calculate Link Budget + RF estimation per cluster (based on gateway height and obstacles)

Please do not delay this any further.
If Aleksandr is unable to follow up on this, indicate so and assign another candidate.
I’ve already asked several times if Alexis can take this on.
I also forwarded the CV of a friend of Alvaro — perhaps he can do it.

In any case, this can no longer wait!

Regards,
Reinder
