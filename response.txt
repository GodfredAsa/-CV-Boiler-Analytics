Subject: Proposal for Pre-Implementation Analysis

Dear Management,

Based on the analysis of the data.xlsx file and the requirements outlined, I propose the following steps before proceeding with the implementation of the CV boiler monitoring system:

1. **Data Validation and Cleaning:**
   - Verify the accuracy and completeness of the data in data.xlsx.
   - Identify and address any missing or inconsistent entries, especially in the 'Opstel Postcode' and 'Toestel type' columns.

2. **RF Coverage Simulation:**
   - Conduct a detailed RF coverage analysis using tools like RadioPlanner or LoRaSim.
   - Simulate Gateway placement based on the following criteria:
     - Urban areas: < 1 km line-of-sight
     - Suburban areas: < 3 km line-of-sight
     - LoRa packet loss < 1% per sensor per 24 hours
     - Min RSSI > –120 dBm
     - Min SNR > –10 dB
   - Identify optimal Gateway locations to minimize the number of Gateways required.

3. **Cost-Benefit Analysis:**
   - Recalculate the cost implications based on the optimized Gateway placement.
   - Compare the costs of individual Gateways versus shared Gateways in dense areas.
   - Assess the potential savings from clustering boilers within postal codes.

4. **Risk Assessment:**
   - Identify potential risks associated with RF interference, signal loss, and Gateway failures.
   - Develop mitigation strategies for each identified risk.

5. **Stakeholder Review:**
   - Present the findings and proposed Gateway placement to key stakeholders.
   - Gather feedback and adjust the plan accordingly.

6. **Pilot Testing:**
   - Implement a pilot test in a selected area to validate the RF coverage and Gateway performance.
   - Monitor and document the results to inform the full-scale implementation.

7. **Documentation and Reporting:**
   - Prepare a detailed report summarizing the analysis, findings, and recommendations.
   - Include visualizations and cost projections to support decision-making.

Please review this proposal and let me know if any additional steps or considerations should be included.

Best regards,
